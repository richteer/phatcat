# phatcat

Have you ever been woken up by your cat at 6 in the morning, and wonder if your roommate already put out food and the cat is a lying jerk that just wants to ruin your quiet Saturday morning?

No?

Well too bad.
This webapp attempts to aid that issue by providing an API to log when that freeloading jerk was last fed.

## Requirements

Right now, this uses django and django-rest-framework for the backend, and angular + bootstrap for the cobbled frontend.
See your platform's documentation (if it exists) for figuring out how to install those.

## Theoretical Features

In theory, this should eventually support:
 - Multiple Cats per user
 - Allowing other users to also feed the cat
 - An actual web UI that doesn't 100% terrible. (Shooting for 90% terrible)
 - Series of mobile apps to interact with the API for that 5:00AM convenience.
 - Probably other things too

## Disclaimer

I am not a web developer.
Take a look at the source, it's pretty obvious.
The base of this code I wrote in a day because I was bored.
Remember, **Pull Requests = Perfection**.
